# Day 1 â€“ NLP Preprocessing: Count Vectorizer, Stemming, Lemmatization

 **Date:** 10 July 2025

Today, I practiced basic text preprocessing techniques in NLP and implemented them in Python.

---

##  Topics Covered

- **Count Vectorization**
  - Converting text into numeric feature vectors.
  - Inspecting vocabulary and feature arrays.

- **Stemming**
  - Reducing words to their root forms using NLTK's PorterStemmer.

- **Lemmatization**
  - Normalizing words to dictionary base forms using WordNetLemmatizer.

##  Files

- `count_vectorizer.ipynb`
- `stemming_and_lemmatization.ipynb`

---

##  Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`

---

##  Key Learnings

- Preprocessing text is essential before training models.
- Stemming is faster but less accurate than lemmatization.
- Count Vectorizer converts text into a sparse feature matrix for ML models.
