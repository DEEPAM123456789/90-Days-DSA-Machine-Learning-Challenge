# 90 Days DSA & Machine Learning Challenge

Welcome to my **90-day journey** to level up my skills in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning**.  
The goal: build discipline, improve problem-solving, and create a strong portfolio of consistent progress.

---

##  Challenge Overview

-  **Duration:** 90 days
-  **Start Date:** 7 July 2025
-  **Focus Areas:**
  - DSA: Leetcode, Striver's SDE Sheet, problem-solving techniques
  - ML: Learning concepts, implementing projects, hands-on practice

---

##  Daily Progress

Every day, I will:
- Solve DSA problems (with clean code and documented approaches)
- Work on ML concepts or mini-projects
- Commit all work to this repository
- Post updates on Twitter/X for accountability

---

- Each **Day-X folder** contains:
  - Code files for problems solved
  - A mini README with links and explanations

---

##  Technologies Used

- C++ for DSA
- Python (and possibly Jupyter Notebooks) for ML
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

##  Why This Challenge?

I believe consistent daily practice is the fastest way to:
- Master core computer science fundamentals
- Improve coding speed and confidence
- Build a public portfolio for future job opportunities
- Develop a habit of lifelong learning
