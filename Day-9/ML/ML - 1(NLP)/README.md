# Article Spinner (NLP Text Rewriter)

This project implements a simple yet effective **Article Spinner** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python. The purpose is to generate alternative versions of a given sentence by replacing words with their synonyms, thereby "spinning" the text while keeping its original meaning intact.
