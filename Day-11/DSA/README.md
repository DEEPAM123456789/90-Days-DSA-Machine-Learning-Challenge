# Day 11 – DSA Progress

## Problems Solved:

### 1. [60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/)
- **Approach**:
  - Construct string from 1 to n.
  - Recursively determine the k-th permutation using factorial logic.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

---

### 2. [567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)
- **Approach**:
  - Use frequency arrays for both strings.
  - Check each sliding window in `s2` to see if it matches `s1`’s frequency.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
