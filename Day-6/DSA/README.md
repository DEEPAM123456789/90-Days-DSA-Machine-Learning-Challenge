---

## Problems Solved

1. **[560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)**
   - Used prefix sum and hashmap to count subarrays summing to k.

2. **[930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)**
   - Same technique applied to binary arrays with target sum.

3. **[974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/)**
   - Applied prefix sum modulo k for counting subarrays divisible by k.
